# Oil & Gold Price Forecasting using VAR and Granger Causality
SAAPM Project

Oil & Gold price forecasting has become an important problem
for academics as well as other stakeholders of the market. In this
project we revisit the research question of significant relationship
between Indian economy and historical oil price. We aim to price
forecast (in INR) and assess the interdependence & causality between IIP index, oil import & export by India, and precious metal
price. We are using a vector auto-regressive model to forecast and
extract relevant inferences. We are using a 12 year rich monthly
data sourced from EPWRF database and evaluated our model on
15 step ahead forecast using standard metrics viz. RMSE, MAPE
etc.
